<h4>Rational Typist Concepts</h3>
<p style='text-align: justify'>Rational Typist is a program that enables your 
hands to memorize keyboard layout and speeds up your touch-typing skills. It is 
based on a simple and original concept that makes training easy, effective, and 
not boring. Rational Typist is not a typical typing program, and it is not designed 
to teach the very first steps e.g. what fingers should type what letters (it 
does not even have visual keyboard layout being constantly present at its UI). 
Rational Typist is the program designed to boost your touch typing skills, 
although, in fact, it can be used by those who have never tried typing with 10 
fingers: making your hands to learn own letters is very easy with Rational 
Typist and soon you don't even need visual keyboard layout.

<p style='text-align: justify'>Its central feature is to help your left and right hands to memorize own range 
of letters i.e. the letters that are typed whether by left or rights fingers.  Therefore Rational Typist 
introduces left-hand and right-hand words, and also left-to-right (L2R) and right-to-left 
words (R2L). The first two modes of the program are designed to help your left and right hands 
to speed up memorizing own range of letters so that letters from arbitrary words your fingers would find 
easy and fast. 
<p style='text-align: justify'>Rational Typist has four modes:
<ul style='text-align: justify'>
<li><b>Mode 1:</b> Beginner mode. Designed to train your left and right fingers to memorize
their letters with left-only and right-only training words. This mode is also useful
when you make a long time break, and your fingers have partially forgotten their training.
<li><b>Mode 2:</b> This mode is for more experienced users when your fingers make no or little
errors in Mode 1 while you don't look at the keyboard. Designed to involve your both left and 
right hands to type without looking at the keyboard using left-to-right and right-to-left training words.
<li><b>Mode 3 (Custom words):</b> Designed for intermediate and more experienced 
users to boost test results by training on problem words. This mode provides you 
with the training words that you pick up by your own in the detailed 
statistics view (Test Mode) after trying the test. For example, you can 
pick up words in detailed statistics where you've made most typing errors,
and spent most time. Rational Typist does not provide default custom list at its 
install, but you can make it easily after any test.
<li><b>Test mode (Mode 4):</b> The mode provides you with a sample text to test your typing speed.
When finishing with test, you can see test statistics: words per minute (WPM),
characters per minute (CPM), typing errors count. In the detailed statistics view you can see
word-based statistics: time spent, errors count for every word in the test. You can check
problem words and create the list of custom training words based on the test results. Mode 3
is used to boost typing performance on these custom words. 
</ul>
<p style='text-align: justify'>Depending on your experience you would practice the following scenarios.
The Scenarios 1 & 2 are designed for novice users, the Scenario 3 can be effectively used by users 
(intermediate and advanced) who don't need to look at the keyboard while training on short texts 
provided by Rational Typist, and the Scenario 4 can be used most effectively (intermediate and 
advanced users) in conjunction with the Scenario 3 to improve speed, reduce typing errors on the texts.
<h4>Scenario 1 of Rational Typist </h4>
<p style='text-align: justify'>If you fingers spend too much time finding their letters, the Mode 1 
will help your fingers to memorize their letters and help you detach your eyes from keyboard while 
typing most simple words. Your aim with Mode 1 is to type left-hand and right-hand words without 
looking at the keyboard. Type any word from the left list (left-hand words) or from the right list
(right-hand words) in any order. In case of an error, the program makes a beep. For example, you 
can type all words from the left with your left hand, then all words from the right with your right
hand, and for the next exercise start from the right list. Refer to the correct 
<a class='clsLink' href='Hands_Positioning.htm'>positioning</a> of fingers if necessary.
<p><div align='center'><img src='Images/Mode1_75.png'></div>  
<p> 
<h4>Scenario 2 of Rational Typist </h4>
<p style='text-align: justify'>When you feel confident with left-only and right-only words and don't look at the 
keyboard, you can train yourself with left-to-right and right-to-left words in the same manner as
with left-only, right-only words in Mode1. Your aim with Mode 2 is to type L2R and R2L words without 
looking at the keyboard. 
<p><div align='center'><img src='Images/Mode2_75.png'></div>

<h4>Scenario 3 of Rational Typist</h4>
<p style='text-align: justify'>When you feel confident with left-only/right-only (Mode1), and 
left-to-right/right-to-left (Mode2) words and don't look at the keyboard while typing them, you 
can train yourself on sample tests in Test mode. Your aim with Test mode is to go through test as 
fast as possible, with minimum typing errors, and without looking at the keyboard.
<p><div align='center'><img src='Images/Mode4_75.png'></div> 
<p style='text-align: justify'>Practice shows that it is meaningless to try 
test mode--while not looking at the keyboard--if you are not sure with touch-typing using training
words in Mode 1 and 2.

<p style='text-align: justify'>When you are finished with the test, the Test mode view is auto-expanded 
to show test statistics:
<p><div align='center'><img src='Images/Mode4_BS_75.png'></div>
<p style='text-align: justify'>The benefit of using Rational Typist is that you can see word-based 
statistics, and boost your typing skills by training on problem words. The detailed statistics view is 
opened (when test is finished) by click on its toolbar icon:
<p><div align='center'><img src='Images/Mode4_DS_75.png'></div>
<p style='text-align: justify'>You can sort word-based test results by click on corresponding column. 
You can create a custom list of training words by checking particular words in detailed statistics 
view and then choosing "Create Custom List" button. Double click opens Color Legend used for words:
<p><div align='center'><img src='Images/Mode4_DS_CL_75.png'></div>
<h4>Scenario 4 of Rational Typist </h4>
<p style='text-align: justify'>Custom mode (Mode 3) is designed for use in 
conjunction with Test mode. Your aim with Mode 3 is to train your hands on words 
("custom words") from previous test where you've made most typing errors, and 
most slowly typed words; and repeat the test to see your progress. The Custom 
mode shows you word-bases statistics while you making an exercise with the list 
of previously selected custom words.
<p style='text-align: justify'>Typically, you make the test, open Detailed Statistics view, then 
mark problem words, and then make custom words by click on "Create Custom Words". Then you improve 
typing performance with problem words in Custom Mode, and it is good to repeat the test again. 
<p><div align='center'><img src='Images/Mode3_75.png'></div>
<p style='text-align: justify'>Practice shows that it makes sense to use the sequence: Test mode - 
Custom mode - Test Mode - Custom mode ... when you pretty sure with Mode 1 and 2 that is when your 
fingers find their characters easily and you don't look at the keyboard with most simple training words. 

<h4>Install and Uninstall</h4>

Windows 7. It was not tested on other Windows flavors.
